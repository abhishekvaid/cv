\section{Profile}

\ifresearch
An entrepreneur who is passionate about intersection of \textbf{Technology, Software and Product}. I have \textbf{10+ years of experience} in building products across multiple verticals. I am currently working as \textbf{Principal Engineer} at \href{https://www.prophecy.io}{Prophecy.io}. In my previous stints, I have assumed role of \textbf{Technical Co-Founder} - \href{https://frrole.ai/}{frrole.ai}, \textbf{Engineering Manager / Technical Architect} at \href{https://www.urbancompany.com/delhi-ncr}{UrbanCompany} and \textbf{Lecturer (Computer Science)} at \href{lpu.in}{LPU}. In these roles, I have lead, managed and mentored teams of varied sizes. I also have extensive hands-on experience and deep interest in disciplines like \textbf{Large scale Data Engineering, Enterprise Software, Machine Learning, Data Science and Micro-service based Software architectures}. During my post-grad, I have contributed to several academic projects and authored several research papers. I am also extremely active on several MOOC platforms like \textbf{edX, Coursera, Udacity, Udemy, educative, cognitiveclass.ai, DataCamp}. Statistically speaking, I spend anywhere between \textbf{10 to 15 hours per week} on these platforms to learn new technologies. I strongly believe in continuous and self-driven growth.

  \item[11/20' – 01/22'] \href{https://app.prophecy.io/}{\textbf{Prophecy.io}} \textbf{Principal Engineer}\hfill Gurugram, India (Remote)
	
	\item[]  \textbf{Prophecy.io} --- Prophecy.io is an SF based startup that offers low code Data Engineering for Spark \& Airflow and is used by top Enterprises. At Prophecy, I headed the Metadata team and was responsible for backend design, execution, delivery and support of key product features and engineering quality. I also spent a lot of time in actively coding and testing these features. Two of my most notable projects are listed below.  \vspace{5pt}
	\begin{itemize} \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
		\item {\textbf{Lineage, Catalog \& Code Search}}  - Designed and implemented the entire Search infrastructure for Prophecy.io core product offering. This was a project with complex product specs where a versioned solution was vital to the success of search functionality. The implementation powers some of the key areas of Prophecy's overall product value like Lineage Search, Expression \& Symbol search, Full-text search on Scala / Python code files, Search on Entities and their Aspects (Avro schema backed JSONs). 
		\item {\textbf{Metadata 2.0 - Versioned Entity Graph}} - Implemented the \textbf{Metadata 2.0} service. This revision was a complete overhaul of earlier Metadata offering and required the implementation of an advance multi-fork two way Git Sync support, Event generation / consumption across micro-services over Kafka and publishing of an sdk (pbt - prophecy build tool) as a standalone module to manipulate entire Metadata entity graph, directly as a part of Git backed files within project repositories. The project also involved productization of advance git functionality like - interactive rebase, squash commits, parallel writes across branches and more. A new GraphQL API was also enabled to make it easy for clients to integrate.
		
	\end{itemize}\vspace{5pt}
	
	\item[09/17' – 11/20'] \href{https://urbanclap.com/}{\textbf{UrbanCompany}} \textbf{Technical Architect / Engineering Manager}\hfill Gurugram, India
	
	\item[]  \textbf{Urban Company} --- Urban Company (UC) is a Gurugram (India) based startup currently disrupting and redefining the online home services domain. Currently, UC is the market leader in India and has presence is 4 more countries. At UC, I own the backend engineering for Consumer Growth. My core responsibility includes having to engage directly with product and engineering VPs to define, plan and execute product and engineering roadmap. During this time, I've also written a lot of systems myself and managed teams of various sizes. \vspace{5pt}

	\begin{itemize} \setlength\itemsep{0.5em}
		
		\item {\textbf{Catalog Revamp 2020 and Search 2.0}} - Architected, Designed and delivered on two of the most important projects of 2020 in Growth Engineering. Both Catalog Revamp 2020 and Search 2.0 proved to be significant in removing technical debt and helped optimize for modern request funnels and App flows across various clients. Both these features brought significant uptake to conversion funnels.
		\item {\textbf{Logging and ELK Stack}} - Architected and implemented Elastic Stack and Logging Funnel. The system consumed 100(GB )/day of system and event logs from 30+ micro-services. 		
		\item {\textbf{Core SEO micro-service}} - Designed and implemented a new API stack to power UC's SEO use-case. Because of this effort, UC enjoyed top positions in 1st page search results (in top 3) for most of the competitive categories in the business.  
		\item {\textbf{Delivery and Pricing  Engine}} - Architected and implemented a service that powers pricing logic throughout the platform. This includes very complex categories like Packers \& Movers and Painters.
		\item {\textbf{Surge and Advance Payment}} - Designed and Implemented Surge and Advance Payment construct on our consumer app.
		\item \textbf{UC Homes/Weddings Content-Portal} - A content-heavy and SEO friendly, service discovery platform. \\ I handled the end-to-end execution of this project from start to end. 
		\item {\textbf{Refactoring}} - As the only architect at UC (at joining), I took key refactoring projects to kill technical debt and implement our internal micro-service framework.
